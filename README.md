# Space Simulation

This project simulates a solar system, allowing users to explore and interact with it.

## Features

- **Movement:** Navigate the simulation using the WASD keys.
- **Zoom:** Use the Z and X keys to zoom in and out.
- **Physics:** The simulation uses physics formulas to calculate planetary movements and interactions.

## Status

This project is a work in progress. Currently, it includes basic functionality, with plans for additional features in the future.

## Future Plans

- Implement more advanced physics and interactions.
- Add more celestial bodies and detailed environments.

## How to Run

Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the CMakeLists.txt file to build and run the simulation.
